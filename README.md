# Image-Segmentation-Image-processing-to-ml-to-deep-learning
This repository contains the code for image processing, We try many approaches of Image Processing, We start with Color based Image segmentation then we try bit-plane slicing then we try Histogram based segmentation and at last Watershed algorithm. then KNN and finaaly we go to Deep Learning.
